# internetmarke-php â€“ Simple PHP wrapper for the 1C4A Internetmarke web service by Deutsche Post

internetmarke-php is a simple PHP wrapper for the 1C4A ("OneClickForApplikation") web service for the Internetmarke provided by Deutsche Post (DPAG).
Its main purpose is to be able to order Deutsche Post stamps directly from your own applications. The payment is handled via Portokasse account, a prepaid wallet service also by Deutsche Post.

The web service by Deutsche Post is a custom SOAP API (see the WSDL here: https://internetmarke.deutschepost.de/OneClickForAppV3?wsdl). This project aims to abstract the SOAP nature away and provide a nice API in PHP, while still adhering to the structure definied by DPAG where reasonable.

## Requirements

To access the web service, you will need to register as a partner with DPAG. This can either be done via there [website](https://www.deutschepost.de/de/i/internetmarke-porto-drucken/partner-werden.html) (German only) or by contacting pcf-1click@deutschepost.de.  
They will send you the documentation for the web service and create your personal credentials (consisting of: your partner ID, a secret key called `SCHLUESSEL_DPWN_MARKTPLATZ`, and a key phase which is usually 1).

In addition, you will need to have an account for the [Portokasse service](https://portokasse.deutschepost.de/portokasse/#/). This is a prepaid wallet from which your purchase totals will be deducted.  
After registering, you can access the service with your username (email address) and password.

## Installation

The package is available via Composer. To install the latest version from Packagist, run:

```
composer require baltpeter/internetmarke-php
```

## Basic Usage

All actions provided by the web service are implemented in the `baltpeter\Internetmarke\Service` class.

This example shows you how to order a single stamp for a domestic letter. Other actions and parameters are documented with phpDoc. For more examples, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/baltpeter/internetmarke-php/wiki/Examples) .

```php
// The `PartnerInformation` object is used to authenticate you as a partner with DPAG.
$partner_info = new \baltpeter\Internetmarke\PartnerInformation('ABCDE', 1, 'yoursecretkey');
// The `Service` object provides an interface for all actions in the web service
$service = new \baltpeter\Internetmarke\Service($partner_info);

// First, we need to get a token for our Portokasse user
$user_token = $service->authenticateUser('portokasse@yourmailserver.tld', 'yourpassword')->getUserToken();

// Next, we create an `OrderItem` which holds the details of the stamp we want to purchase
$order_item = new \baltpeter\Internetmarke\OrderItem(1, null, null, new \baltpeter\Internetmarke\Position(1, 1, 1), 'FrankingZone');

// Finally, we call `checkoutShoppingCartPdf()` which creates the order and actually deducts the money from your Portokasse
// The last parameter in this example is the total cost which you have to calculate manually. This value *has* to be correct, it is checked on the server side.
var_dump($service->checkoutShoppingCartPdf($user_token, 1, array($order_item), 70));
```

Running this code will print a result similar to this:

```php
object(stdClass)#10 (3) {
  ["link"]=>
  string(111) "https://internetmarke.deutschepost.de/PcfExtensionWeb/document?keyphase=0&data=abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwxyz"
  ["walletBallance"]=>
  int(236725)
  ["shoppingCart"]=>
  object(stdClass)#11 (2) {
    ["shopOrderId"]=>
    string(9) "12345678"
    ["voucherList"]=>
    object(stdClass)#12 (1) {
      ["voucher"]=>
      array(1) {
        [0]=>
        object(stdClass)#13 (1) {
          ["voucherId"]=>
          string(20) "A0011E78E1000001234A"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The stamp in the linked PDF will look something like this:
